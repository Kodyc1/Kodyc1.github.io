About
I am currently a Computer Science and Mathematics double major at the University of California, Irvine.  My areas of interest are Information and Numerical Analysis,
which focuses on data mining, database management, machine learning, and statistical modeling. While those are my main focus, I am also always open to learning new
topics within the subject, such as computer networking, computational mathematics, front-end development, and other diverse parts of the field.
